# HR Management Portal

A full-stack role-based Human Resource Management System built with **React (frontend)**, **Node.js + Express (backend)**, and **MongoDB (database)**. This system allows an organization to manage employees, departments, attendance, leave requests, and internal announcements with secure access control for admins and employees.

---

## Project Overview

This portal provides a centralized HR interface for managing employees and departments, monitoring attendance, handling leave requests, and sharing company-wide announcements. The system is accessible through two types of users: **Admins** (full control) and **Employees** (restricted self-service access).

## Security Measures

* Secure password hashing using bcrypt
* JWT-based authentication and role authorization
* Route protection using middleware on both frontend and backend
* Server-side validation of attendance (prevent duplicate check-ins, spoofing)
* Role-specific dashboards and restricted routing
* Helmet, CORS, and environment separation for safe deployment

---

## Future Improvements

* Employee password reset/change flow
* Email notification for leave approvals
* Attendance analytics and reports
* CSV/PDF export of reports
* Admin dashboard with graphical insights
* React admin panel enhancements (filters, pagination, etc.)
